# ISAP-1.5 computer Block Diagram
The ISAP-1.5 Computer is the improved version of the ISAP-1 computer made by me.

ISAP Computer stands for Improved Simple as Possible Computer.

This is the first stage of the design of the ISAP-1.5 Computer and consists of the process of optimizing the functionality of the ISAP-1 computer at the Block Diagram level.

## About the project, brief description
The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the ISAP-1 (Simple As Possible) computer with minimal modifications, which has instructions encoded in 8 bits.

The second condition is that the Program Counter remains 8 bits.

## ISAP-1.5 version 1.0
